A "sketchpad" that draws while you hover over a pixel.

-Added container, figured out pixel to container ratio. Test hover thing, must be implemented with js file later. Need to figure out best way to change pixel size without screwing up ratio. I like the idea of fixed choices via radio-buttons.

-Struggled with toggle all day, finally got classes to change and cursor no long draws over painted pixels (as planned), but the mouseenter event still changes the .pixel class regardless of whether draw is true or fale. While-loop seems to crash the browser, do not try!
